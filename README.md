About
=====

The Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) is a standard software library
for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving
systems of linear equations and linear least squares problems,
eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition.
It also includes routines to implement the associated matrix factorizations
such as LU, QR, Cholesky, etc. LAPACK was originally written in FORTRAN 77,
and moved to Fortran 90 in version 3.2 (2008). LAPACK provides routines
for handling both real and complex matrices in both single and double precision.

The objective of LAPACK++ is to provide a convenient, performance oriented API
for development in the C++ language, that, for the most part,
preserves established conventions, while, at the same time, takes advantages
of modern C++ features, such as: namespaces, templates, exceptions, etc.

LAPACK++ is part of the project
[Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale](http://icl.utk.edu/slate/)
(SLATE), which is funded by the [Department of Energy](https://energy.gov)
as part of its [Exascale Computing Initiative](https://exascaleproject.org)
(ECP).

Closely related to LAPACK++ is the
[BLAS++ project](https://bitbucket.org/icl/blaspp), which aims at providing
a C++ API for the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS).
